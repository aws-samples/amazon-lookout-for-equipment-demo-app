Welcome to Lookout for Equipment Demo Application!
==================================================

This application will help you assess quickly if your industrial data contains 
any historical anomaly of interest. After you upload a dataset containing 
sensor measurements from your industrial equipment or manufacturing process, 
you will be guided to train an anomaly detection model. You will then be able 
to visualize your model results and deploy it, making it ready to receive your 
shop floor live data. This application also includes an operational dashboard 
to visualize your live results.
