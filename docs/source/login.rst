First time login
----------------

After your administrator :ref:`deployed the app <admin installation>` in an
AWS account, you will receive a link to log into the application. In parallel,
you will receive an email with your temporary credentials to login. The first
time you open the application link, you will be presented with a login page:

.. note::
    If your administrator allowed in-app creation of new users, you will have a
    second tab where you will be able to create a new user on a self-serve 
    basis.

Enter the username and password received by email: you will be immediately 
prompted to create a new one. After you're done, you will land on the welcome
page of the application:

.. _login user_creation:

User creation
-------------

There are two ways to manage users to access this application: in app or manual.


If your administrator **allowed users to sign up directly in the app**, you will see 
a **Create account** tab on the login page:

Fill in your user information and click on the **Create account** button to create
your account and be automatically logged in.

**If in app sign up is not enabled**, your administrator will have to create your 
user in the backend. See :ref:`Creating users <admin user_creation>` to learn more.
