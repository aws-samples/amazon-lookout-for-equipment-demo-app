First time login
----------------

After your administrator :ref:`deployed the app <admin installation>` in an
AWS account, you will receive a link to log into the application. In parallel,
you will receive an email with your temporary credentials to login. The first
time you open the application link, you will be presented with a login page:

.. note::
    If your administrator allowed in-app creation of new users, you will have a
    second tab where you will be able to create a new user on a self-serve 
    basis.

Enter the username and password received by email: you will be immediately 
prompted to create a new one. After you're done, you will land on the welcome
page of the application:
